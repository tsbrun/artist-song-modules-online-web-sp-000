TDD Principles

  1) Define behaviors of end result program.

  2) Write tests for the program.
    => When you do a, expect b.
    => Consider potential exceptions and errors.

  3) Write code to make the tests pass.
    => And ONLY the code needed to make tests pass.

  4) Refactor code to follow DRY, SSOT, & other principles.
    => Refactoring often involves repeating step 3.
