TDD Principles

  1) Define behaviors of end result program.

  2) Write tests for the program.
    => When you do a, expect b.
    => Consider potential exceptions and errors.

  3) Write code to make the tests pass.
    => And ONLY the code needed to make tests pass.

  4) Refactor code to follow DRY, SSOT, & other principles.
    => Refactoring often involves repeating step 3.

Other Notes

  - When defining class methods in a module ( that will be extended to other classes ),
    the self keyword is omitted ( from the method name ).
    The extend keyword handles the responsibility of demarcating certain methods as belonging to classes.

  - You use gsub on a string to replace part of it.
      e.g, name.downcase.gsub(' ', '-')
           => make a name lowercase
           => replace single-blank space characters with a hyphen
